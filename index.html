      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Ocelot! (Leopardus Pardalis) The ocelot is found in Mexico and South and Central America. It has also been spotted as far north as Texas in the United States. An estimated 800,000 to 1.5 million are found worldwide. In the U.S., just 30 ocelots remain in an isolated population in southeast Texas."><img src="img/ocelot.png" alt="ocelot" id="ocelot"></span>
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Howler Monkey (Alouatta palliata) A population analysis conducted by Cortes-Ortiz et al. (1996) in southern Mexico estimated that a total of 1,352 individual mantled howler monkeys inhabit protected areas, while 10,249 remain in unprotected habitat."><img src="img/howlermonkey.png" id="howler" alt="howler monkey"></span>
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). The giant panda is only found in central and western China, and only 1000 to 2000 remain in the wild."><img src="img/panda.png" id="panda" alt="panda"></span>
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Hyena (Crocuta Crocuta). With only four extant species, it is the fifth-smallest biological family in the Carnivora, and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia.[2] Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems. Estimated numbers left in the wild: Between 27000 to 47000."><img src="img/hyena.png" id="hyena" alt="hyena"></span>
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Lion (Panthera Leo). The lion has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, as populations in African range countries declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. According to Panthera, lions have disappeared from 90 percent of their historic range due to habitat loss, hunting and poaching, retaliatory killings by livestock owners, loss of prey and other factors."><img src="img/lion2.png" id="lion" alt="lion"></span>
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Yak (Bos mutus). The Wild Yak (Bos mutus) lives at elevations of 4,000 to 6,100 meters in the alpine tundra, grasslands and cold desert regions of the Tibetan plateau. The worldwide population has probably declined more than 30% in the last 3 decades, and in 1995, was estimated to number a mere 15,000 individuals."><img src="img/yak.png" id="yak" alt="yak"></span>
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Blue Whale (Balaenoptera musculus). At up to 29.9 metres (98 ft)[4] in length and with a maximum recorded weight of 173 tonnes (190 short tons)[4] and probably reaching over 181 tonnes (200 short tons), it is the largest animal known to have ever existed. Pre-whaling population estimates were over 350,000 blue whales, but up to 99% of blue whales were killed during whaling efforts. Presently, there are an estimated 5-10,000 blue whales in the Southern Hemisphere, and only around 3-4,000 in the Northern Hemisphere."><img src="img/bluewhale.png" id="whale" alt="blue whale"></span>
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Wolverine (Gulo Gulo).  It is a stocky and muscular carnivore, more closely resembling a small bear than other mustelids. The wolverine, a solitary animal,[1] has a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion to its size, with the documented ability to kill prey many times larger than itself. The world's total wolverine population is not known. The animal exhibits a low population density and requires a very large home range.[28] The wolverine is listed by the IUCN as Least Concern because of its 'wide distribution, remaining large populations, and the unlikelihood that it is in decline at a rate fast enough to trigger even Near Threatened.'">
      <img src="img/wolverine.png" id="wolverine" alt="wolverine"></span><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus). Grey parrots may live for 40â€“60 years in captivity, although their mean lifespan in the wild appears to be shorter at about 23 years. Humans are by far the largest threat to wild grey populations. Between 1994 and 2003, over 359,000 grey parrots were traded on the international market. Around 21% of the population of the wild birds are being harvested every year. Mortality rates are extremely high after they are captured until they reach market, ranging from 60 to 66%.[8] Mortality among imported birds is high.[13] This bird is also hunted for its meat and for its parts are used in traditional medicines.[14] As a result of the extensive harvest of wild birds, in addition to habitat loss, this species is believed to be undergoing a rapid decline in the wild and has therefore been rated as endangered by the IUCN.[1]">

      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Yellow-footed rock-wallaby (Petrogale xanthopus). The population of yellow-footed rock wallabies has fallen in recent years, with less than 10,000 living in the wild today. The population decline is due in large part to the introduction of goats, sheep, and rabbits in the region.">
