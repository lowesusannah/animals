blue whale        water/everywhere
                  The blue whale is the largest of all whales and is said to be the largest animal in Earths history. The average length of an adult blue whale is 79 to 88 feet and the average weight is 130 to 150 tons. Blue whales are blue to blue-gray and may sometimes appear to have a faint yellow skin color because of the many microorganisms that accumulate on their bodies as they travel through colder waters. Blue whales prefer cold waters and open seas and prefer not to venture near coastal areas. However, some whales have been seen off the coast of Peru.

                  The blue whale eats mostly krill (small shrimp-like crustaceans) by using its baleen plates lining its mouth to sieve krill from the water. It can consume several tons of krill daily. Researchers have believed that the blue whale only eats in the summer, seldom eating during the rest of the year. But recent research has suggested that some blue whales of the north may eat year-round and that blue whales found traveling with empty stomachs may stop eating during migration and resume feeding at wintering areas. Blue whales only mate in warmer waters and the gestation period lasts 10 to 11 months. The females give birth to only one calf in the spring which gives the calf the entire summer to grow a layer of blubber needed to protect it when traveling through colder waters. The calves nurse for around seven months.

                  There are three subspecies of blue whales. The blue whales of the northern and southern hemispheres generally come together for mating, but they are considered two separate subspecies, Balaenoptera musculus musculus and Balaenoptera musculus intermedia. The third subspecies, the pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda), is smaller than the others, and it is found in the sub-Antarctic waters of the Indian Ocean and the southeast Atlantic Ocean. Over 350,000 whales have been hunted and killed, and by the 1960s, blue whales were on the edge of extinction. There are probably only around 2500 blue whales left in the oceans and they are now legally protected despite opposition by the whaling industry.


ocelot            usa to central/south america
                  The ocelot is found in Mexico and South and Central America. It has also been spotted as far north as Texas in the United States. Adults can weigh up to 24 lbs and can reach up to five feet in body length. The coat of the ocelot is very similar to that of the jaguar. Its coat varies in color from whitish or tawny yellow to reddish gray to gray and its underside is white. Its entire body is covered with black-bordered blotches that are lighter in color in the center.

                  Ocelots prefer to live in densely covered habitat and are able to thrive in a variety of different types, ranging from dense thorn scrub to mountainous regions and tropical forest. They are generally nocturnal and are solitary, but some ocelots of the same sex have been found sharing trees for resting. They are also very territorial and will sometimes fight to the death for their territory. The diet of the ocelot includes small mammals, such as monkeys and rodents, snakes, fish, amphibians, and birds. Mating can occur year round, and the females give birth to two to four kittens after an estimated 70-day gestation period.

                  The main threat to the species is deforestation and habitat destruction. Also ocelots have a small litter size and one of the longest gestations and growth rates among the small cats, and a high infant mortality rate. Before ocelot hunting was banned, hundreds of thousands of ocelots were killed for their fur which was once considered very valuable causing a decline in numbers in many countries. Ocelots are now legally protected.
howler monkey     mexico to south america
                  The mantled howler monkey is found in southern Mexico and Central and South America. It is named for its fringe of long, golden-brown hair along the sides, called a "mantle." It also gets its name from the roaring howl that it makes when communicating or alerting others of a disturbance. Adults are very large and stocky with black fur. Most individuals have long, yellow or brown fur saddles. The average weight of an adult is around 12 to 13 lbs, and males are larger than females.

                  This species can be found in lowland and montane rainforests at altitudes as high as 2000 meters. They prefer to remain in the trees since they do not move well on the ground. They are often seen walking or climbing through the trees or suspending themselves below branches, hanging by their arms or tails while feeding. Diet consist of fruit, leaves, and flowers. They are very social and live in groups of 10 to 20 individuals with one alpha male. Breeding occurs throughout the year, and females give birth to one young after a gestation period of six months.

                  This species is threatened by habitat destruction, rainforest fragmentation and natural disasters. It is legally protected, and about 1300 individuals can be found in protected areas.

hyena             asia africa mideast europe
                  Also called the Barbary hyena, the striped hyena is a close relative of the brown hyena of southern Africa. It is found throughout northern and eastern Africa, Arabia, Asia Minor, and India. Hyenas are sometimes thought to be members of the dog family, but are very unique creatures having their own family, Hyaenidae. They have broad heads with dark eyes, thick muzzles, and large, pointed ears. The coat varies in color, from gray to light brown with black stripes. Their legs also have stripes, and the front legs are longer than the hind legs. Striped hyenas also possess a mane of long hair that can be raised making them appear much larger than their actual size. This deceptive behavior can help with intimidatiion during confrontations or when they are felt threatened. Adults reach about three to four feet in head and body length, their fluffy tails grow over 12 inches, and they may weigh between 55 and 121 lbs. Males and females are similar in appearance, but females are slightly larger.

                  Striped hyenas are found in savannas, thorn bushes, and stony desert regions, and they prefer to remain within six miles of a water source. They are not as social as the brown hyena and are sometimes found alone or only in small groups with one dominant female. They are mainly active at night, and prefer to feed on dead animals killed by other predators. They also eat insects, reptiles, small mammals, eggs, and even fruit and vegetables. Mating can occur at any time of the year, and female gives birth to two to four young after a gestation period of three months.

                  This species is threatened by loss of habitat and hunting. Also, striped hyenas are known to kill humans (especially children) and livestock and are often trapped or killed. They are also hunted for their body parts which are used in medicine. The North Africa and Arabia populations may become extinct in the near future. Many striped hyenas can be found in zoos.
panda             china
                  The giant panda is an extremely rare animal found mainly in the Western Szechwan province of southwest China. The giant panda can weigh from 165 to 330 lb. The head and body of the panda is mainly white with the exception of its ears, eye patches, nose, shoulders, arms, and legs. The giant pandas eyes are very small and its vision is poor. Enlarged bones in its wrists allow it to grip bamboo stems. They have very strong jaws and large molar teeth that are used to crush the tough bamboo stems. Pandas are very good climbers and use their skill to escape predators. They are also able to move quickly and silently allowing them to evade predators through tunnels of bamboo.

                  Giant pandas eat mostly bamboo leaves and shoots. But they can also eat fruit and berries, fungi, grass, and even small mammals, birds and fish. Pandas live alone most of their lives, only coming together when it is time to mate. Females give birth to cubs that are hairless and blind and weigh only 100g. Cubs depend on their mothers for about 18 months, and then it is time to find and establish its own territory. They use their scent glands beneath their tails for marking territory.

                  The giant panda is only found in central and western China, and only 1000 to 2000 remain in the wild. Causes of their decline include destruction of habitat and poaching. And the panda is heavily dependent upon its main food source, bamboo, which is becoming rare in its habitat. In an effort to save this species, the World Wildlife Fund and the Chinese Ministry of Forestry have developed a conservation management plan outlining 14 new panda reserves and five corridors connecting patches of panda habitat. This species is also legally protected to prevent poaching.
yak               asia
                  The yak is an ox species found in Central Asia. A very large percentage of the yak population is domesticated, but one vulnerable wild yak population still exists in the Tibetan plateau. Adults stand about 6.5 feet tall at the shoulder and can weigh over 1800 lb, and they can grow over 11 feet long in head and body length. Females are smaller than males. Their coats are extremely shaggy, dense, and wooly and dark brown to black in color with white patches. Some golden wild yaks have been observed, but they are very rare. The shoulders are high and humped, and the head is very large. Yaks also possess horns on their heads that curve upward, and they can grow over a foot long in females and 3.4 feet long in males. The horns are used for digging under the snow for food.

                  Wild yaks prefer grasslands for their habitat and they are usually found in areas where there are lots of lichens, grasses, and tubers. When food becomes scarce, some herds migrate long distances to find these plants. They seem to enjoy colder temperatures and do not favor warm weather. Much of the time is spent grazing on grass-like plants and shrubs, forbs, and cushion plants. Herds as large as 200 females and their young have been observed. Males prefer to be along or will band together in small solitary groups of two to five. When they are ready to mate, they separate to join female herds. They may even compete violently with other males to gain dominance over a herd. Females give birth to one calf in June after a gestation period of nine months.

                  The latest population estimate for this creature if 15,000. The main cause of decline is hunting by humans. Also, habitat disturbance, hybridization, and competition with domestic yaks pose a threat to the species. The remaining wild yak population is legally protected, but according to the Tibet Forest Bureau, this is difficult to enforce in some mountainous regions. Some wild yaks are protected in the Chang Tang Reserve in China.

wolverine         Canada, China, Estonia, Finland, Mongolia, Norway, Russia, Sweden
                  The wolverine (/ˈwʊlvəriːn/), Gulo gulo (Gulo is Latin for "glutton"), also referred to as the glutton, carcajou, skunk bear, or quickhatch, is the largest land-dwelling species of the family Mustelidae. It is a stocky and muscular carnivore, more closely resembling a small bear than other mustelids. The wolverine, a solitary animal,1 has a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion to its size, with the documented ability to kill prey many times larger than itself.

                  The wolverine is found primarily in remote reaches of the Northern boreal forests and subarctic and alpine tundra of the Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest numbers in northern Canada, the US state of Alaska, the mainland Nordic countries of Europe, and throughout western Russia and Siberia. Its population has steadily declined since the 19th century owing to trapping, range reduction and habitat fragmentation. The wolverine is now essentially absent from the southern end of its European range.
grey parrot       africa
                  The grey parrot is a medium-sized, predominantly grey, black-billed parrot. Their average weight is 400 grams (0.88 lb), with an average length of 33 centimetres (13 in)[2] and an average wingspan of 46–52 cm.[3] The Congo species is a lighter grey, with darker grey over the head and both wings, while the head and body feathers have a slight white edge to them. The tail feathers are red. The Timneh is a darker grey and has a dark maroon coloured tail as well as having a portion of their beak being light pink in colour. Due to artificial selection by parrot breeders, some Congo grey parrots are partially or completely red.[4] Both sexes appear similar.[2] The colouration of juveniles is similar to that of adults, but the eye is typically dark grey to black, in comparison to the yellow irises around dark eyes of the adult birds.[5] The undertail coverts are also tinged with grey.[2] The adults weigh between 418 and 526 grams.[6]

                  Grey parrots may live for 40–60 years in captivity, although their mean lifespan in the wild appears to be shorter at about 23 years.[3]
